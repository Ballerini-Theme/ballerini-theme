# ‚ù§Ô∏è Contributing
First, we would like to thank you who want to contribute and keep improving our project.

Here we have a set of steps and guidelines to make the contribution of our Ballerini Theme project as simple as possible. Everything was done for better clarification of doubts for those who want to help, adding something or creating the theme for some application/tool. I hope this guide will be helpful in your journey of contributing young padawan.
## üåê Language
Although the project is made by natives of the Portuguese language, it will be mandatory to use the English language while contributing in a Ballerini Theme repository.
### For native English speakers
Please use simple words and sentences. Don't make fun of non-native English speakers. If you find something wrong with the way they express themselves, try to encourage newcomers and those who are learning English.

Our philosophy is: create an environment where people feel comfortable to learn.
## üí° Creating a new themes
To create and upload a new theme, you need to follow the following steps:
1. Create a new repository based on the [template](https://github.com/Ballerini-Theme/template). <br>
  a) The branch name must be `main`, for more information read the [newspaper article](https://www.zdnet.com/article/github-to-replace-master-with-main-starting-next-month/). <br>
  b) The repository name must follow lowercase pattern and have only the application/tool name. E.g. `visual-studio-code`.
2. Build the new the using the [Ballerini Theme Color Palette](https://github.com/Ballerini-Theme/ballerini-theme#color-palette). <br>
  a) You can be using all the colors or just the ones you needed to create the theme.
3. Submit and issue with link to your repository. As soon as the theme is accepted, we will move the repository under the Ballerini Theme organization.
4. Open a PR (Pull Request) to add the theme to the main repository (this one). Add it under its respective category (if it doesn't exist, you can create one). Also, make sure it is in alphabetical order. <br>
5. Finally, after your theme is under the organization, update all links to match the new repository `<URL>`.
6. If you think you can improve your theme, share it with others who also use it for that application, so that more people can use it and contribute together.
## üìé Maintaining a theme
After your theme is under the Ballerini Theme organization, you're responsible for maintaining it. It's your responsibility to answer issues, review PR's and always keep them up to date.

Below you can find some guidelines that we follow:

- Always open pull requests when updating the theme (the `main` branch is protected by default);
- Review issues and PRs periodically;
- When you're going to add a new theme maintainer, add it in the README (team section) and the CODEOWNERS file in .github;
- Share the theme on forums, Twitter and communities, to spread the word about your theme;
- In case you have any questions, reach out to [Alpha Vylly](https://github.com/AlphaLawless)
