# ❤️ Contributing
First, we would like to thank you who want to contribute and keep improving our project.

Here we have a set of steps and guidelines to make the contribution of our Ballerini Theme project as simple as possible. Everything was done for better clarification of doubts for those who want to help, adding something or creating the theme for some application/tool. I hope this guide will be helpful in your journey of contributing young padawan.
## 🌐 Language
Although the project is made by natives of the Portuguese language, it will be mandatory to use the English language while contributing in a Ballerini Theme repository.
### For native English speakers
Please use simple words and sentences. Don't make fun of non-native English speakers. If you find something wrong with the way they express themselves, try to encourage newcomers and those who are learning English.

Our philosophy is: create an environment where people feel comfortable to learn.
