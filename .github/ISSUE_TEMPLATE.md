## :bulb: [Creating a new themes](https://github.com/Ballerini-Theme/ballerini-theme/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#-creating-a-new-themes)

- [ ] Create a new repository based on the [template](https://github.com/Ballerini-Theme/template).
- [ ] Build the new theme by using the [Ballerini Theme Color Palette](https://github.com/Ballerini-Theme/ballerini-theme#color-palette).
- [ ] Submit and issue with a link to your repository. As soon as the theme is accepted, we will move the repository under the Ballerini Theme organization.
- [ ] Open a PR (Pull Request) to add the theme to the main repository (this one). Add it under its respective category (if it doesn't exist, you can create one). Also, make sure it is in alphabetical order.
- [ ] Finally, after your theme is under the organization, update all links to match the new repository `<URL>`.
- [ ] If you think you can improve your theme, share it with others who also use it for that application, so that more people can use it and contribute together.
